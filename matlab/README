Before running the script, ensure that the CSV files are in the current working directory.

regresion.m

	This file contains the functions for performing ridge regression using the closed form solution.
	It can be run in Matlab by executing the following:
	
		regression();
	
	The CSV file whose data is to be used can be chosen by uncommenting the appropriate lines in the loadData() function.

averageError.m

	This file contains the script for running the regression algorithm multiple times and averaging the results.
	It can be run in Matlab by executing the following:

		averageError
	
	Once it is done executing, it will output the average training error and test error over the 30 executions.

Note: Since the training/validation/test sets are chosen at random, the results will differ slightly each time it is run.
